1. How to run and interact with the work
Mouse movement
Move the mouse over the canvas: a blue-black “black hole” follows the cursor.

Mouse wheel 
Scroll up/down while the cursor is over the canvas to change the black hole radius.

Road squares 
Small coloured squares (red/blue/grey) move along the yellow gaps like traffic.
When they enter the black hole radius, they disappear (get “swallowed”).

Speed slider 
Below the canvas there is a slider labelled Speed Change.
Drag it to make all moving squares slower or faster (0×–3×).

Keyboard 

R – regenerate a new layout (new grid, gaps, blocks, agents).

E – pause / resume the movement of all road squares.
